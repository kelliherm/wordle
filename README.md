## Rules

In the game Wordle, you have to guess a hidden five-letter word within six tries, using color-coded feedback to guide subsequent guesses. A green tile means the letter is correct and in the right spot, yellow means the letter is in the word but in the wrong spot, and gray means the letter isn't in the word at all. Your guess must be considered a valid English word.

## How to Play

It is recommended to use `uv` for this project in order to simplify dependency management.

```shell
uv run main.py
```
